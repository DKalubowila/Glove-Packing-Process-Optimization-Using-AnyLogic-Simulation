# Glove-Packing-Process-Optimization-Using-AnyLogic-Simulation
This project focuses on optimizing a glove packing production line using AnyLogic simulation. Two system models were developed — a manual (current) system and an automated (future) system — to measure performance, identify bottlenecks, and analyze improvements after automation.
